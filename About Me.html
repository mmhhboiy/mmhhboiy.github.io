            Yo. I'm Sofia M. from Granada High School; I am in 11th grade, so a junior, I am also a member of the class of 2020. I don't believe there is much to say about me, in all honesty. At least, not personality-wise. I will say that I do have a lot of interests. I enjoy drawing, both digitally and traditionally, guitar, writing, reading, and listening to music.

            My art, I think, is hard to understand without context. Most of my art is in reference to something else, usually a song. For example, "Coffin Dancer", which is pictured below, is a reference to a music video for a song called "Coffin Dance". The other pieces featured below are "Bad, Bad Things" and "Now That I'm at the Top of My Game". This, like "Coffin Dancer", is also a reference to a music video of the same name. A lot of my art is in reference to music, and most of it features topics not suitable for school, so I am not going to reference a lot of it here.

            I absolutely love to play guitar. I can, and have, played for hours straight. I usually play music from a certain band called AJJ, formerly known as Andrew Jackson Jihad. I have and play a 3/4th-size, Greg Bennette, acoustic guitar that I've had since 5th grade. While I did take some guitar lessons in 5th, 6th, and 7th grade, I never finished it nor did I really learn anything. While I did learn how to read music as well as recognize the notes on a guitar, I didn't learn anything past that. I never learned how to strum, use a pick, or play chords; I had to teach myself how to do all that. But that's beside the point, after 7th grade, I stopped taking lessons and stopped playing guitar, preferring to focus on my flute. I have recently made the decision to stop playing the flute, as it simply doesn't make me happy anymore. During the summer of 2018, I decided to start to play my guitar again, as I was inspired by a band. I continue to love to play guitar to this day.

            As of the time of writing this, the last book I have finished was "I, Robot" by Isaac Asimov. I actually finished it today (8/30/2018). I quite enjoyed it (my favorite character is Michael Donovan). I thought that the ideas explored in the book were interesting. It is definitely a good read. But this isn't a book report so I'm going to leave it here. Update! I started reading "Dune" by Frank Herbert (or something like that. I don't feel like checking it.) So that's cool.

            I love music and it is rare for me to not want to listen to music. My bands are the aforementioned AJJ and Green Day. As of the time of writing this, I have just pre-ordered AJJ's newest album (AJJ's Ugly Spiral: Lost Works 2012-2016). (Update! It arrived!) My top three favorite AJJ albums are The Bible 2, AJJ's Ugly Spiral, and Christmas Island. My top three favorite Green Day albums are 21st Century Breakdown, American Idiot, and Nimrod. I do like artists and albums outside of the ones mentioned here, but it would be hard to mention it all. I enjoy collecting CDs, though I don't have a lot. I have 21st Century Breakdown, American Idiot, Nimrod, and Warning from Green Day; Out of Time, Automatic for the People by REM; Flood by They Might Be Giants; and as I previously mentioned, I have recently pre-ordered another. I have gone to two concerts and one music festival so far. I went to a Green Day's Revolution Radio concert in the Oakland Coliseum sometime in 2017 (It was either August or September, I'm not sure). Just this year, I went to an AJJ concert, well to say that it was an AJJ concert would be inaccurate, as Kimya Dawson, a grammy-award winning artist was also there, as well as a band called Shell Shag. They each played for about an hour, so it was a rather long concert. The venue was rather small, called "The Chapel", and located in San Francisco. I adored it! In the end, I bought an AJJ t-shirt.
